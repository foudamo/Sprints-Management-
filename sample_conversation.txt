Sprint Planning Meeting - December 12, 2024
Topic: Real-time Task Management System Enhancement

Sarah (Product Owner): Good morning everyone! Today we need to plan our next sprint focusing on enhancing our real-time task management system.

Mike (Tech Lead): Thanks Sarah. From the technical side, we need to improve our WebSocket implementation and add better error handling.

Emma (Frontend Dev): I agree. I've noticed some UI lag when updating task states. We should optimize that.

John (Backend Dev): We should also consider implementing a caching layer to reduce database load.

Sarah: Great points! Let's break these down into specific tasks.

Mike: I can take on the WebSocket optimization. I'll need about 3 days to:
- Implement connection pooling
- Add reconnection logic
- Set up proper error handling with retries

Emma: For the UI improvements, I'll handle:
- Implement debouncing for real-time updates
- Add loading states for better UX
- Optimize render performance with React.memo
- Update the progress bar component

John: I'll work on the backend optimizations:
- Set up Redis caching layer
- Implement cache invalidation logic
- Add performance monitoring
- Write documentation for the caching system

Sarah: Sounds good! Alex, can you help with the testing?

Alex (QA): Sure! I'll:
- Create end-to-end tests for the real-time updates
- Set up performance testing scenarios
- Document test cases
- Verify cross-browser compatibility

Sarah: Great! Let's also make sure we have proper documentation. Maya, can you help with that?

Maya (Technical Writer):
- Update API documentation
- Create user guide for new features
- Write release notes
- Update troubleshooting guide

Sarah: Perfect! Let's aim to complete this in the next two weeks. Any questions?

Mike: No, I think we're good to go. We'll have daily standups to track progress.

Sarah: Excellent! Let's get started then.
