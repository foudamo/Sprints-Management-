# Troubleshooting History - Frontend/Backend Communication Issues

## Issue Description
Frontend and backend services are not communicating properly despite multiple configuration attempts.

## Key Symptoms
1. Frontend can serve static content but API requests fail
2. Backend health checks failing with 404s
3. ALB target group health checks failing
4. Service discovery DNS resolution failing

## Configuration Changes Made

### 1. ALB Configuration
- Renamed frontend listener to http listener for clarity
- Configured proper routing rules:
  - Priority 100: /api/* and /health/* routes to backend
  - Priority 200: /* routes to frontend
- Added proper health check paths

### 2. Nginx Configuration
- Added proper root and index directives
- Configured /health endpoint to return 200
- Updated API proxy to use service discovery DNS
- Added proper proxy headers
- Added CORS headers

### 3. Backend Configuration
- Simplified URL handling (removed URL rewriting)
- Added explicit health check endpoint
- Improved error handling and logging

### 4. Service Discovery
- Using proper service discovery DNS format:
  sprints-management-backend-service-dev.sprints-management:3001

### 5. Frontend Configuration
- Changed API_URL to relative path (/api)
- Let nginx handle the proxying

### 6. Infrastructure Issues Encountered
- AWS DNS resolution failures:
  ```
  Error: fetching Availability Zones: operation error EC2: DescribeAvailabilityZones
  lookup ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: no such host
  ```
- Root cause: DNS resolution failing for AWS service endpoints
- Impact: Unable to apply infrastructure changes

### 7. Infrastructure Fixes Required
- Verify AWS CLI configuration and credentials
- Check network connectivity to AWS endpoints
- Ensure DNS resolution is working properly
- Verify VPC DNS settings:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
    enable_dns_hostnames = true
    enable_dns_support   = true
  }
  ```

## Lessons Learned
1. URL rewriting should be minimal and consistent
2. Health checks need explicit endpoints
3. Service discovery DNS is crucial for container communication
4. Proper ALB routing rules priority is important
5. CORS headers needed on both nginx and backend
6. Relative URLs are better for frontend/backend communication
7. Infrastructure changes require proper DNS resolution
8. VPC DNS settings are crucial for service discovery

## Next Steps
0. Fix AWS endpoint DNS resolution issues:
   - Check local DNS settings
   - Verify AWS CLI configuration
   - Test connectivity to AWS endpoints
1. Verify service discovery DNS resolution
2. Check container security groups allow communication
3. Verify ECS task IAM roles have proper permissions
4. Monitor CloudWatch logs for both services
5. Test API endpoints directly from within containers
